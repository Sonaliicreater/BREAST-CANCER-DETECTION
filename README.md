# BREAST-CANCER-DETECTION
Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women, with around one in every 19 women at risk. The number of cases of breast cancer is gradually increasing, especially as the population ages. The mammography screening procedure has to be improved and made more efficient. When it comes to medical imaging, there is always space for improvement. Cancer patients' chances of dying are reduced if they are diagnosed early. The goal of this paper is to find the identification of breast cancer using a deep learning model network. Image preparation, categorization, and performance evaluation are all part of the total process. In this research, using the Breast Histopathology Images dataset, we examine the effectiveness of the deep learning model, InceptionResnet, in classifying the presence of IDC(Invasive Ductal Carcinoma). In terms of accuracy, the trained model gave an accuracy of 91%.
